# Starbucks capstone project

Starbucks capstone project belongs to Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Motivation

The main motivation for the development of this project is to provide a consistent and valid model that allows the creation of interest offers for the clients of any company, in this case starbucks.

## Resources


The project has the following different resources in file form:

The analysis, cleaning, data exploration and construction of models based on the dataset created as a result of the previous steps is divided into two files that should be executed in the following order:

#### Jupyter Notebooks:

`Starbucks_Capstone_notebook1.ipynb`

`Starbucks_Capstone_Challenge_Building models.ipynb`

#### Datasets:

On the other hand, the initial datasets used for this project are the following:

data/`portfolio.json`: containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)

data/`transcript.json`: records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

data/`profile.json`: demographic data for each customer


As a result of the data wranglig and feature engineering operations, two new datasets are created:

data/`portfolio_cleaned.csv`: processed information related to initial portfolio dataset

data/`combined_data.json`: dataset prepared and built in the first notebook with the objective of building the classification models
